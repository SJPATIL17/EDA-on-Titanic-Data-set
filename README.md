# EDA-on-Titanic-Data-set
This repository provides a detailed data cleaning and exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It explores factors contributing to passenger survival, uncovering insights, trends, and relationships. The analysis uses data preprocessing and visualizations to offer a clear understanding of key features in the dataset.

Dataset Overview
The Titanic dataset contains information on passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship. Key features include:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Pclass: Passenger's class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Fare paid by the passenger
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Embarkation port (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Survived: Survival status (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)

Project Goals
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values and incorrect data types
Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns
Encode categorical variables for analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Statistical summaries and basic visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots)
Investigate relationships between features such as gender, age, and class with survival rates

Insight Generation:
Identify patterns, such as higher survival rates among women and higher-class passengers.
Visualize and analyze how different factors impacted survival chances.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebooks
